  <h1>Whole of Life Premiums — Guaranteed vs Reviewable</h1>
  <p class="lead">This guide explains the difference between guaranteed and reviewable premiums in whole of life policies. It is general information only — <strong>not</strong> advice.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What Are the Two Main Premium Types?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Guaranteed premiums:</strong> Set at the outset and designed to stay the same throughout the policy, as long as terms are met.</li>
      <li><strong>Reviewable premiums:</strong> Set initially, then reviewed at intervals set out in the policy (for example every 5 or 10 years). At review, the insurer may change premiums in line with policy rules.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Why Reviews Happen (High Level)</h3>
    <p>Reviewable premiums can change due to factors referenced in the policy, such as insurer assumptions, charges, longevity experience, or investment performance if benefits are linked to with-profits/unit-linked structures. The policy sets out the method and timing of review.</p>
    <p class="muted">Exact mechanisms vary by provider and product. Always check the policy literature for how reviews are calculated.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Potential Pros &amp; Cons (Information Only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Guaranteed:</strong> Price certainty; usually higher initial premium than a comparable reviewable structure.</li>
      <li><strong>Reviewable:</strong> Often lower initial premium; future costs can rise or fall at review under policy rules, affecting affordability.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What If Premiums Change on Review?</h3>
    <p>Policies usually explain the options at review (for example, accept a revised premium; keep premiums the same and adjust benefits; or other options permitted by the product). The specific choices and implications depend on the contract.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Other Features that Can Affect Cost</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Smoker status, age and underwriting:</strong> Risk factors influence initial price and, for reviewable plans, future projections under policy rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefit level:</strong> Higher sums assured typically mean higher premiums.</li>
      <li><strong>With-profits/unit-linked variants:</strong> Where benefits are linked to investments, bonus rates or unit values can influence outcomes under the policy’s method.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Illustrative Examples (Not Advice)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example A:</strong> A person who prefers cost certainty may favour guaranteed premiums, understanding the higher fixed cost.</li>
      <li><strong>Example B:</strong> A person who prioritises lower initial cost may consider reviewable premiums, recognising costs may change at review.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">These examples are generic to explain concepts only. Individual needs vary.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Key Points to Remember</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Guaranteed = price certainty; Reviewable = price can change under policy rules.</li>
      <li>Check the policy for review timing, methodology and available options at review.</li>
      <li>Tax treatment and product features can change; professional advice may help with tax/estate planning.</li>
    </ul>

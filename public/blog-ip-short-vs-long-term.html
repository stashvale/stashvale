  <h1>Short-Term vs Long-Term Benefits</h1>
  <p class="lead">This article explains, in plain English, how benefit durations differ and the usual trade-offs people consider. <strong>Information only — not advice.</strong></p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What Do “Short-Term” and “Long-Term” Mean?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Short-term benefits:</strong> Pay out (if a valid claim is accepted) for a limited period such as 1, 2 or 5 years per claim.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-term benefits:</strong> Could pay (if a valid claim is accepted) until a cease age (e.g., 60, 65 or state pension age), subject to policy terms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">Availability, cease ages and limits vary by product and underwriting.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Typical Trade-Offs (Price vs Cover Length)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Premium level:</strong> Short-term benefit periods are often lower-cost than long-term cover because potential payouts are capped.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk you carry:</strong> Short-term cover may leave a gap if illness or injury lasts longer than the cap; long-term cover reduces that specific risk but can cost more.</li>
      <li><strong>Return-to-work support:</strong> Some policies include rehabilitation or proportionate benefit features. Terms vary.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Non-Advisory Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cease age and occupation:</strong> Manual and risk-sensitive roles can have different underwriting or availability compared with office-based roles.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-term commitments:</strong> Mortgage or family costs that continue for many years are a common reason people look at longer benefit durations.</li>
      <li><strong>Budget &amp; priorities:</strong> Some people prioritise affordability now and review cover later; others prioritise longer protection from the outset.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Illustrative Scenarios (Not Advice)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scenario A:</strong> Someone with good employer sick pay and savings might focus on longer-term risks and consider a longer benefit period.</li>
      <li><strong>Scenario B:</strong> A person seeking a lower premium might consider a short-term benefit period and plan to review cover in future.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Short-term cover usually costs less but caps the claim duration.</li>
      <li>Long-term cover generally costs more but reduces the risk of running out of benefit during long illnesses, subject to policy terms.</li>
      <li>Always check definitions, exclusions, cease ages and underwriting details in the policy documents.</li>
    </ul>

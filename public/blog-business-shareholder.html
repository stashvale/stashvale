  <h1>Shareholder Protection Explained</h1>
  <p class="lead">A high-level explanation of how shareholder protection policies can support ownership continuity if a shareholder dies or suffers a critical illness. <strong>Information only — not financial, legal, tax or accounting advice.</strong></p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Shareholder protection aims to provide funds so that shares can be purchased from a shareholder (or their estate) on death or specified critical illness, in line with an agreed arrangement. This can help remaining owners retain control and provide fair value to the outgoing party or their beneficiaries.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Core Ingredients (Information Only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Legal agreement:</strong> Typically a cross-option, buy-sell, or business will agreement that sets out how shares may be bought and at what valuation basis.</li>
      <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Policies aligned to the agreement and ownership model to provide funds on a specified event.</li>
      <li><strong>Valuation method:</strong> A method for valuing the business or the shares (e.g., formula or independent valuation).</li>
      <li><strong>Regular reviews:</strong> Shareholder changes, valuations and policy levels usually need periodic review.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Common Structures (Summary Only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Own-life in trust:</strong> Each shareholder holds a policy on their own life in trust for the others. On death, the proceeds are available to those beneficiaries to purchase shares under the agreement.</li>
      <li><strong>Company share purchase:</strong> The company takes out policies on shareholders and may use proceeds to buy back shares, subject to company law requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>Partnership versions:</strong> Variations exist for partnerships and LLPs. Legal advice is important.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">Which approach is suitable depends on company structure, shareholder circumstances and legal/tax considerations. Professional advice is commonly obtained.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Cover &amp; Practical Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Life only or life with critical illness:</strong> Policies can include or exclude critical illness depending on needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Sum assured:</strong> Often linked to each shareholder’s stake and the agreed valuation basis.</li>
      <li><strong>Underwriting:</strong> Medical and financial underwriting typically applies; non-disclosure can affect claims.</li>
      <li><strong>Trusts:</strong> Trusts are frequently used to help route proceeds correctly and efficiently.</li>
      <li><strong>Company law &amp; documentation:</strong> Formalities (board minutes, share buy-back rules, filings) may apply.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Tax &amp; Accounting (High Level)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tax treatment of premiums and proceeds varies with structure and purpose. Rules can change.</li>
      <li>Accounting presentation may differ by jurisdiction and standards.</li>
      <li>Inheritance tax positioning can depend on share valuation, relevant reliefs, and trust arrangements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help">Specialist <em>regulated</em> advice, plus legal, tax and accounting input, is usually essential for shareholder protection.</p>

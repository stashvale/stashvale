  <h2>Business Protection</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Business protection refers to insurance designed to help businesses survive financial shocks when key people die or become critically ill. 
    These policies can help provide funds to protect profits, repay loans, or buy out shares. 
    <strong>Information only — not advice or a personal recommendation. Rules, products and tax treatment can change.</strong>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What It Is (Plain English)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Business protection typically involves life cover or critical illness cover taken out on key individuals within a business.</li>
      <li>It can help ensure the business can continue trading or reorganise its finances after an unexpected event.</li>
      <li>Policies can be arranged for different legal structures — limited companies, partnerships, or LLPs — depending on needs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help">
      Business protection is designed to protect the business, not the individual personally. Tax treatment depends on circumstances.

    <h3>Key Types of Business Protection</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Key Person Cover:</strong> Pays out if a key employee, director or shareholder dies or is diagnosed with a critical illness. Helps replace lost profits, recruit replacements or stabilise finances.</li>

      <li><strong>Shareholder / Partnership Protection:</strong> Provides funds to remaining owners so they can buy the shares of a deceased or critically ill partner/shareholder — helping maintain control and continuity.</li>

      <li><strong>Business Loan Protection:</strong> Designed to repay outstanding business debts if a key individual dies or is critically ill, protecting the business from cashflow pressures.</li>

      <li><strong>Relevant Life Plans:</strong> Tax-efficient life cover arranged by an employer on behalf of an employee or director. Paid through the business but benefits the employee’s family or beneficiaries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Things to Consider (Information Only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Structure matters:</strong> Ownership, taxation and beneficiary arrangements vary between limited companies, partnerships and LLPs.</li>

      <li><strong>Valuation & sum assured:</strong> Cover should broadly reflect the financial impact of losing the key person, partner or shareholder.</li>

      <li><strong>Trusts & agreements:</strong> Shareholder protection is often supported by legal agreements and trusts. Specialist legal and tax advice is usually required.</li>

      <li><strong>Underwriting:</strong> Insurers will assess age, health, lifestyle and the business relationship to set terms and premiums.</li>

      <li><strong>Tax treatment:</strong> Varies by policy type, ownership structure and purpose. HMRC guidance can change. Independent tax advice is strongly recommended.</li>

      <li><strong>Policy reviews:</strong> Business valuations, structures and personnel change over time. Reviews help keep cover appropriate.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="help">
      Business protection often involves complex legal, tax and commercial considerations. 
      Regulated financial advice, legal support and tax guidance are strongly recommended before arranging cover.

  <h2>Business Protection</h2>
  <p class="lead">Business protection insurance helps safeguard a company’s future if a key person, shareholder or director dies or becomes critically ill. <strong>This page is for information only and does not provide regulated financial advice.</strong></p>

    <h3>What Is Business Protection?</h3>
    <p>Business protection is a type of life or critical illness insurance designed to protect the financial stability of a business if something unexpected happens to a key person. It ensures the company can continue trading, repay debts, buy out shares, or cover recruitment and training costs.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Key Types of Business Protection</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Key Person Insurance:</strong> Pays a lump sum to the business if a key employee or director dies or is diagnosed with a critical illness. This can help replace lost profit or cover recruitment costs.</li>
      <li><strong>Shareholder / Partnership Protection:</strong> Provides funds for the remaining business owners to buy the shares of a deceased or critically ill shareholder, helping retain control and ensure smooth succession.</li>
      <li><strong>Relevant Life Policy:</strong> A tax-efficient life insurance policy arranged by a business on behalf of an employee or director, providing benefits to their family if they die while employed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help">Policies are typically paid for by the business and can often be structured in a tax-efficient way — but advice from a regulated adviser is recommended before taking out a policy.</p>

    <h3>Why Businesses Consider Protection</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide financial stability after the loss of a key revenue generator or decision-maker.</li>
      <li>To protect shareholder control and ensure smooth ownership transitions.</li>
      <li>To attract and retain staff by offering relevant life cover as a benefit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help">The right type of protection will depend on your company’s size, structure and financial obligations.</p>

  <h2>Whole of Life Insurance</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Whole of life insurance is designed to stay in force for the rest of your life and pay a lump sum whenever you die (as long as premiums are maintained).
    It’s often used to help with funeral costs, gifts to family, or estate planning.
    <strong>Information only — not financial advice.</strong>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What it is (Plain English)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cover is intended to last your whole life, not a fixed term.</li>
      <li>A lump sum is paid when you die, provided the policy is in force at that time.</li>
      <li>Premiums are usually paid monthly; depending on the policy, they can be guaranteed or reviewable.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Key Features & Options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Guaranteed vs reviewable premiums:</strong> Guaranteed stay fixed (unless you choose indexation); reviewable may change over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Indexation:</strong> Option to increase your cover each year to help with inflation (premiums typically increase too).</li>
      <li><strong>Guaranteed whole of life (GWoL):</strong> Often used for funeral provision or leaving a set amount to beneficiaries.</li>
      <li><strong>Joint life options:</strong> For couples, policies can be set up as joint life first-death or second-death (often used in estate planning).</li>
      <li><strong>Trusts:</strong> Writing the policy in trust can help benefits go to the right people quickly and may assist with estate administration.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Whole of Life vs Term Assurance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Whole of Life:</strong> Designed to pay out whenever death occurs (premiums required throughout or to a specified paid-up point). Useful where a payout is expected to be needed whenever death happens.</li>
      <li><strong>Term Assurance:</strong> Covers you for a set period only (e.g., 20–30 years). Often used for mortgage protection or while children are financially dependent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help">People sometimes combine products — for example, a term policy for mortgage/children plus whole of life for final expenses or legacy planning.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Things to Consider (Information Only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Affordability over time:</strong> Premiums are paid for a long period; reviewable premiums and indexation can increase cost.</li>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Clarify if the aim is funeral provision, a gift/legacy, or part of wider estate planning.</li>
      <li><strong>Trusts & beneficiaries:</strong> Consider whether a trust is appropriate so the payment goes as intended.</li>
      <li><strong>Underwriting:</strong> Health and lifestyle can affect terms, exclusions, or whether cover is offered.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Deeper Detail (For those who want more)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Paid-up or limited-pay options:</strong> Some policies allow premiums for a fixed period (e.g., 10/20 years), after which cover continues.</li>
      <li><strong>With-profits/unit-linked variants:</strong> Some legacy products link to investments and can have variable values/premiums.</li>
      <li><strong>Second-death policies:</strong> Sometimes used alongside estate planning; timing and ownership/trust setup can matter.</li>
    </ul>

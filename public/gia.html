  <h2>General Investment Account (GIA)</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    A General Investment Account (GIA) is a flexible way to invest in funds, shares, ETFs, and other investments 
    without the annual tax-free limits of an ISA.

    <h3>How a GIA Works</h3>
    <p>
      A GIA is one of the simplest ways to invest. You can put in as much money as you like, with no annual 
      contribution limits, and withdraw funds at any time. Unlike an ISA, your gains, dividends, and income 
      may be subject to tax — but this flexibility makes GIAs useful once you've used up your ISA allowance.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>💼 <strong>Flexible investing:</strong> No annual contribution limits and no restrictions on withdrawals.</li>
      <li>📊 <strong>Choice of investments:</strong> Funds, shares, ETFs, and other market-linked assets.</li>
      <li>💡 <strong>Taxable:</strong> Gains and income above your personal allowances may be subject to capital gains tax (CGT) or income tax.</li>
      <li>🔁 <strong>No lock-in:</strong> You can sell and withdraw money at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When a GIA Might Be Useful</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>✔️ You've already used your annual ISA allowance (£20,000 for 2025/26).</li>
      <li>✔️ You want the flexibility to invest and withdraw without restrictions.</li>
      <li>✔️ You plan to invest long term and are comfortable with potential tax liabilities.</li>
      <li>✔️ You're building wealth for goals that don't require tax shelters (like short- to medium-term investing).</li>
    </ul>

      <li>💸 <strong>Dividend Tax:</strong> Dividends above the £500 annual allowance may be taxed.</li>
      <li>📊 <strong>Income Tax:</strong> Income from certain investments may count toward your total taxable income.</li>

  <h1>Occupation Definitions Explained</h1>
  <p class="lead">This article explains common Income Protection occupation definitions and why they matter. <strong>Information only — not advice.</strong></p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Why Definitions Matter</h3>
    <p>The occupation definition describes the circumstances in which a claim may be considered. It affects eligibility and how claims are assessed. Always check the wording in the specific policy.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Common Definitions (Plain English)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Own occupation:</strong> A claim is generally assessed on whether you can carry out the material and substantial duties of <em>your own job</em> as normally performed. This is commonly preferred where available, but availability and wording vary.</li>
      <li><strong>Suited occupation:</strong> Assessment may consider whether you could reasonably perform another role suited to your education, training and experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Any occupation / work tasks:</strong> Assessment can consider whether you can perform any work, or specific tasks (e.g., lifting, standing, keyboard work). Wording differs by product.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">Names and criteria differ between providers. Always read the policy terms.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Other Factors That Can Influence Claims</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Part-time or proportionate benefits:</strong> Some policies may pay a reduced benefit if you can return in a limited capacity. Terms vary.</li>
      <li><strong>Exclusions:</strong> Pre-existing conditions, hazardous hobbies or specific medical exclusions may apply depending on underwriting.</li>
      <li><strong>Definition changes:</strong> In some policies the definition can change after a period of claim (for example, shifting from “own occupation” to a broader test). Check the wording.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Illustrative Examples (Not Advice)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example A (Own occupation):</strong> A graphic designer unable to carry out the key duties of their role due to a hand injury may be considered under the policy’s “own occupation” wording, subject to terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Example B (Suited occupation):</strong> A former engineer might be considered for roles compatible with experience and training if the policy uses a “suited” definition.</li>
    </ul>

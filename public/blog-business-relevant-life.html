  <h1>Relevant Life Policy Basics</h1>
  <p class="lead">A Relevant Life Policy (RLP) is a type of employer-paid life assurance arranged on the life of an employee (including directors who are employees), with benefits normally payable to a nominated trust. <strong>This guide is information only — not financial, tax, legal or accounting advice.</strong></p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What It’s Aimed To Do</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide life cover for an individual employee outside a registered group scheme.</li>
      <li>Allow the employer to pay premiums. Benefits are usually written in trust for the employee’s beneficiaries.</li>
      <li>Offer a potential tax-efficient way to provide death-in-service-style cover for certain employees, subject to rules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">Eligibility depends on the insurer’s criteria and local rules. Sole traders covering themselves personally do not typically fit the usual use case.</p>

    <h3>High-Level Tax &amp; Compliance Notes (Non-Exhaustive)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tax treatment:</strong> Depends on purpose, policy terms and circumstance. Tax rules and HMRC practice can change.</li>
      <li><strong>Wholly &amp; exclusively test:</strong> Employer deductibility may depend on this and other factors — professional advice is usually sought.</li>
      <li><strong>Trusts:</strong> Policies are commonly written in a discretionary trust so benefits can be paid to beneficiaries efficiently.</li>
      <li><strong>Pensions interaction:</strong> RLPs are separate from registered pension schemes; rules differ.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h3>Typical Features (Information Only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cover type:</strong> Life cover; critical illness is usually not included in conventional RLP frameworks.</li>
      <li><strong>Sum assured:</strong> Often linked to a multiple of salary or total remuneration, subject to provider limits.</li>
      <li><strong>Term:</strong> Usually aligned to employment term or planned retirement age; terms vary by provider.</li>
      <li><strong>Underwriting:</strong> Medical and sometimes financial underwriting applies; non-disclosure can affect claims.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Who Commonly Considers RLPs?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Small companies wanting life cover for one or more employees or director-employees.</li>
      <li>Firms without a group life scheme but wishing to provide death-in-service-style cover.</li>
      <li>Businesses looking for an employer-paid arrangement where benefits are routed via trust.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help">Suitability is case-specific. Regulated, tax and legal advice is typically obtained before setting up a policy.</p>

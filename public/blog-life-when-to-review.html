  <h2>When to Review Your Life Insurance</h2>
  <p class="lead"><strong>Information only — not financial advice.</strong> Many people choose to look over their life insurance from time to time to check it still aligns with their situation, especially after major life changes.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Common Triggers People Consider</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>New home or mortgage:</strong> Repayment amounts and terms can change over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Marriage, separation or children:</strong> Household needs and priorities may shift.</li>
      <li><strong>Income changes:</strong> Salary rises or reduced hours might alter what feels appropriate.</li>
      <li><strong>Debts paid down:</strong> Some people find their cover amount or term feels high relative to remaining commitments.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What People Typically Check</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Amount of cover:</strong> Whether the lump sum or income would still support key outgoings.</li>
      <li><strong>Type of cover:</strong> If level, decreasing or family income benefit still fits household preferences.</li>
      <li><strong>Policy term:</strong> Whether the end date still lines up with needs (e.g., mortgage finish date).</li>
      <li><strong>Beneficiaries or trust arrangements:</strong> Ensuring paperwork reflects current wishes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help">Insurer definitions, exclusions and processes vary. Check the policy schedule and Key Facts for the definitive position.</p>

    <h3>Myth vs Reality</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “If nothing big changed this year, there’s no point looking.” <br><strong>Reality:</strong> Some people prefer a light check-in periodically to stay familiar with what they have.</li>
      <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “All life insurance is the same.” <br><strong>Reality:</strong> Features and definitions differ by insurer, and by product type.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Key Questions to Ask Yourself</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Would your family still be able to manage ongoing costs with the current payout?</li>
      <li>Has your mortgage or other borrowing changed since you took out the policy?</li>
      <li>Do your beneficiaries and any trust arrangements reflect your current wishes?</li>
    </ul>

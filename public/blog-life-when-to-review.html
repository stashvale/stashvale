  <h2>When Should You Review Your Life Insurance?</h2>
  <p class="lead">Life doesn’t stand still — and neither should your life insurance. It’s good practice to review your policy regularly to ensure it still meets your needs. <strong>This article is for information purposes only and not financial advice.</strong></p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Major Life Events That Might Trigger a Review</h3>
    <p>Many people take out a policy and never revisit it, but that can mean their cover no longer matches their circumstances. Consider a review after:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Buying a property or remortgaging:</strong> A larger mortgage might require increased cover.</li>
      <li><strong>Marriage or divorce:</strong> New responsibilities — or fewer — can affect how much protection you need.</li>
      <li><strong>Having children:</strong> Growing your family usually increases the amount of financial support required.</li>
      <li><strong>Career changes:</strong> Promotions or job changes can alter income, lifestyle, and future needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Starting a business:</strong> Personal protection might need to be supplemented by business cover.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Other Reasons to Check Your Cover</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Over time, the value of your payout could erode. Some policies offer increasing cover options.</li>
      <li><strong>Changing health:</strong> If your health improves, you might find more competitive premiums elsewhere.</li>
      <li><strong>Policy type or length:</strong> Your original choice (e.g. decreasing vs. level term) might no longer be suitable.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>How Often Should You Review?</h3>
    <p>Most experts suggest reviewing life insurance <strong>every 2 to 3 years</strong> — or sooner if you experience any of the major life events listed above.</p>
    <p>Even if nothing major has changed, it’s worth checking that your policy still aligns with your financial goals and responsibilities.</p>

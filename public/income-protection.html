  <h2>Income Protection</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Income protection is designed to pay a monthly benefit if illness or injury stops you working,
    after a waiting period. It helps cover regular bills while you recover.
    <strong>Information only — not financial advice.</strong>
  </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What it is (Plain English)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You choose a monthly benefit (typically a % of pre-disability income) and how long the cover lasts.</li>
      <li>If you meet the policy’s claim definition after the waiting period, the insurer pays a monthly benefit until you return to work, reach your benefit end date, or hit the policy’s limit.</li>
      <li>Payments are usually tax-free for individuals (UK) but tax treatment can vary — check personal circumstances.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Key Features & Options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deferred period:</strong> The wait before payments start (e.g., 1, 4, 8, 13, 26 weeks). Longer waits usually cost less.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefit duration:</strong> Short-term (e.g., up to 1–2 years per claim) or long-term (to end of term or selected cease age).</li>
      <li><strong>Claim definition:</strong> “Own occupation”, “suited occupation”, or “any occupation” (own-occ is generally the strongest).</li>
      <li><strong>Premium type:</strong> Guaranteed (fixed) or reviewable (can change). Some policies offer age-banded pricing.</li>
      <li><strong>Indexation:</strong> Option to increase benefit each year to help keep pace with inflation (premiums normally rise too).</li>
      <li><strong>Extras:</strong> Rehabilitation support, fracture cover, hospitalisation benefit — varies by insurer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Things to Consider (Information Only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Work & sick pay:</strong> How long would employer sick pay last, and how does that align with your deferred period?</li>
      <li><strong>Self-employed income:</strong> Proof of income at claim can matter — check how your policy verifies benefit.</li>
      <li><strong>Budget & priorities:</strong> Deferred period, benefit level, and duration have a big impact on cost.</li>
      <li><strong>Underwriting:</strong> Health, lifestyle, and occupation can affect premiums, exclusions, or if cover is offered.</li>
      <li><strong>Existing cover:</strong> Check if you have any employer or personal cover already to avoid overlaps.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Deeper Detail (For those who want more)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proportionate/rehabilitation benefits:</strong> Some policies pay partial benefits if you return part-time or to a lower-paid role.</li>
      <li><strong>Evidence at claim:</strong> Medical evidence and income verification are typically required.</li>
      <li><strong>Cease age & term:</strong> Common cease ages include 60, 65, or state pension age; premiums reflect the risk to that age.</li>
      <li><strong>Tax & structure:</strong> Personal vs business policies can be taxed/treated differently — seek professional guidance.</li>
    </ul>

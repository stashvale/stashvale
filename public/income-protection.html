  <h2>Income Protection</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Income protection is designed to pay a regular income if you’re unable to work due to illness or injury. 
    It can help replace part of your earnings for as long as the policy lasts or until you can return to work. 
    <strong>Information only — not advice or a personal recommendation. Terms and conditions vary by insurer.</strong>
  </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>How It Works (Plain English)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You choose how much of your income you’d like to protect (usually up to a percentage of your earnings).</li>
      <li>You also choose a deferred period — the length of time after becoming unable to work before payments start.</li>
      <li>Once a claim is accepted, the policy pays a monthly income until you return to work, the policy ends, or you reach the maximum benefit period.</li>
      <li>Benefits are typically tax-free if you pay for the policy personally (but this can depend on your circumstances and tax rules at the time).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Key Types & Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Short-term vs Long-term:</strong> Short-term policies pay for a limited period (e.g. 1 or 2 years), while long-term policies can pay until the policy term ends or you retire.</li>
      <li><strong>Own occupation cover:</strong> Pays out if you can’t do your own job. Alternative definitions (e.g. suited occupation or any occupation) may offer different levels of protection.</li>
      <li><strong>Guaranteed premiums:</strong> Stay the same throughout the term. Reviewable premiums can change over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Indexed cover:</strong> The benefit amount can increase annually to help keep pace with inflation, though this often means premiums rise too.</li>
      <li><strong>Waiver of premium:</strong> Premiums may be waived during a claim so you don’t have to keep paying while receiving benefits.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Things to Consider (Information Only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deferred period:</strong> Choosing a longer deferred period can lower the cost but means you wait longer for payments. Some use savings or employer sick pay to bridge this gap.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefit level:</strong> You can’t usually cover 100% of income — there are maximums to prevent over-insurance. Check the insurer’s rules carefully.</li>
      <li><strong>Occupation definitions:</strong> “Own occupation” is generally broader protection, but check wording as it varies between insurers.</li>
      <li><strong>Exclusions:</strong> Many policies have standard exclusions (for example, pre-existing conditions, self-inflicted injury, or specific occupations with higher risk).</li>
      <li><strong>Affordability & review:</strong> Regularly review cover as your income, job role, or personal circumstances change.</li>
      <li><strong>Underwriting & disclosure:</strong> Applications require honest and full disclosure. Non-disclosure can affect claims.</li>
      <li><strong>Tax position:</strong> Tax rules can change, and treatment depends on individual circumstances.</li>
    </ul>

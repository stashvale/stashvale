  <h2>Critical Illness Cover</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Critical illness cover pays a lump sum if you’re diagnosed with a serious condition that meets your policy’s definition.
    It can help with treatment costs, changes to work, or covering bills while you recover.
    <strong>Information only — not financial advice.</strong>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What it is (Plain English)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You choose an amount of cover and a term (how many years the policy runs).</li>
      <li>If you’re diagnosed with a listed condition that meets the policy definition during the term, it pays out once.</li>
      <li>You can buy it on its own (standalone) or combined with life insurance.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Key Types & Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Standalone vs Combined:</strong> Standalone only pays for critical illness. Combined policies often pay once for either life or critical illness, depending on the claim.</li>
      <li><strong>Level vs Decreasing:</strong> Level cover keeps the payout the same; decreasing cover reduces over time (often used with repayment mortgages).</li>
      <li><strong>Additional Payments:</strong> Some policies pay smaller amounts for certain “additional” conditions without ending the policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Children’s Cover:</strong> Many insurers include optional children’s cover with set limits and listed conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Indexation:</strong> Option for your cover (and premium) to increase annually, helping keep up with inflation.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Things to Consider (Information Only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definitions vary:</strong> Each insurer has its own wording for what counts as a claim. Always read the policy documents.</li>
      <li><strong>Scope of cover:</strong> Critical illness is not the same as income protection; it’s a one-off lump sum, not a monthly income.</li>
      <li><strong>Budget & priorities:</strong> Higher cover amounts, wider definitions, and add-ons (like children’s cover) can increase cost.</li>
      <li><strong>Term & purpose:</strong> Align the policy term to your needs (e.g., mortgage length or a key family milestone).</li>
      <li><strong>Trusts:</strong> Placing policies in trust can help benefits go to the right people; consider independent guidance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deeper Detail (For those who want more)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ABI model wordings:</strong> Many policies reference industry model definitions but can be stricter or broader.</li>
      <li><strong>Severity tiers:</strong> Some conditions pay at different severities; a diagnosis alone may not be sufficient if the criteria aren’t met.</li>
      <li><strong>Survival periods & exclusions:</strong> Some policies have minimum survival periods after diagnosis, and general exclusions (e.g., non-disclosure).</li>
      <li><strong>Underwriting:</strong> Your medical history, age, and lifestyle can impact price, exclusions, or whether cover is offered.</li>
    </ul>

    What It Covers
  </div>

  <h2>Critical Illness: What It Actually Covers</h2>
  <p class="lead"><strong>Information only — not advice.</strong> Critical illness cover (CIC) usually pays a benefit if a listed medical condition meets the policy’s definition during the term. The exact wording varies by insurer and by product version.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>How policies typically work</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A claim is considered when a <strong>specified condition</strong> is diagnosed to the <strong>severity defined</strong> in the wording.</li>
      <li>Most policies pay a <strong>lump sum</strong>; many also include <strong>partial payments</strong> for lower-severity definitions.</li>
      <li>Waiting or survival periods and exclusions can apply, depending on the policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help">Insurer definitions are decisive. Names of conditions can look similar across providers while criteria differ.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Commonly listed conditions (examples)</h3>
    <p>Policies often include certain cancers, heart attack, stroke, multiple sclerosis, major organ transplant/failure and a selection of neurological conditions. Each condition has its own definition and evidence requirements.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Partial payments & additional features</h3>
    <p>Many modern CIC plans pay a smaller benefit for specified early-stage diagnoses. Some products include or offer <strong>children’s cover</strong> with separate limits and eligible ages. Availability and amounts vary by insurer.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What’s not usually covered</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Conditions <strong>not listed</strong> or that don’t meet the severity definition.</li>
      <li>Pre-existing conditions where excluded.</li>
      <li>Events outside the policy term, or where premiums weren’t maintained.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Underwriting & disclosure</h3>
    <p>Applications typically ask about health, lifestyle and family history. Accurate disclosure helps the insurer assess eligibility and price. Non-disclosure can affect future claims.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>How claims usually progress</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Notify the insurer and provide requested medical evidence.</li>
      <li>The claim is assessed against the policy definition.</li>
      <li>If approved, the benefit is paid according to the rules (full or partial).</li>
    </ol>

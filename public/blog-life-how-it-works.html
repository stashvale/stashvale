  <h2>How Life Insurance Works</h2>
  <p class="lead">Life insurance is designed to provide a financial safety net for your loved ones if you pass away during the policy term. This guide explains how it works in simple, non-technical terms. <strong>This page is for information only and is not financial advice.</strong></p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What Is Life Insurance?</h3>
    <p>Life insurance is a contract between you and an insurance company. In exchange for regular payments (called premiums), the insurer agrees to pay a lump sum or regular income to your chosen beneficiaries if you die during the term of the policy.</p>
    <p>That payout can be used by your family to cover living costs, pay off a mortgage, fund education, or help maintain their standard of living. The purpose is simple: to provide financial security at a difficult time.</p>

    <h3>The Main Types of Life Insurance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Level Term:</strong> Pays a fixed lump sum if you pass away during the term. Premiums are usually fixed too.</li>
      <li><strong>Decreasing Term:</strong> The payout amount reduces over time, often in line with a repayment mortgage. Typically cheaper.</li>
      <li><strong>Family Income Benefit:</strong> Rather than a lump sum, this pays a regular monthly income for the rest of the policy term.</li>
      <li><strong>Whole of Life:</strong> Covers you for your entire life (rather than a set term), so a payout is guaranteed. Usually more expensive.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>How Premiums Are Calculated</h3>
    <p>Premiums are based on risk factors assessed by the insurer. These usually include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your age and gender</li>
      <li>Your health and lifestyle (e.g. smoking, medical history)</li>
      <li>The amount and length of cover</li>
      <li>Whether the payout is level or decreasing</li>
      <li>Additional features, such as critical illness cover</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In most cases, the younger and healthier you are when you take out a policy, the lower your monthly premiums will be.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What Happens When a Claim Is Made?</h3>
    <p>If you pass away during the policy term, your beneficiaries or representatives make a claim to the insurer. They’ll need to provide a death certificate and complete a claims form. Once the insurer confirms the claim is valid, the payout is typically made within a few weeks.</p>
    <p>To ensure the payout goes where you want it to, you can consider writing the policy “in trust”. This means it is paid directly to your chosen beneficiaries and usually avoids forming part of your estate for inheritance tax purposes.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Key Things to Remember</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Life insurance is not a savings product — if you outlive the policy term, there’s no payout.</li>
      <li>It’s important to keep your details accurate when applying. Misrepresentation can invalidate a claim.</li>
      <li>Review your cover regularly, especially after major life events such as buying a house, having children, or changing jobs.</li>
    </ul>

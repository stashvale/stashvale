  <h2>How Life Insurance Works</h2>
  <p class="lead"><strong>Information only — not financial advice.</strong> This guide explains, in plain English, how life insurance policies generally operate, the common types of term cover, how insurers assess applications, and what typically happens at claim time. Details vary by insurer, so always check the policy documents.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What a Life Insurance Policy Does</h3>
    <p>Life insurance is designed to pay money if the person insured dies during the policy’s active period (the “term”). The money may be a single lump sum or a regular income, depending on the type of policy chosen. People often use it to help loved ones manage bills, debts, childcare, or other commitments.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Common Types of Term Cover</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Level term:</strong> The payout amount stays the same for the whole term.</li>
      <li><strong>Decreasing term:</strong> The payout reduces each year, often used alongside repayment mortgages.</li>
      <li><strong>Family Income Benefit (FIB):</strong> Instead of a lump sum, this pays a regular income for the rest of the policy term.</li>
      <li><strong>Whole of Life (separate product):</strong> Designed to last for life, usually at a higher long-term cost. See <a href="whole-of-life.html">our overview</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help">Terms, exclusions and definitions differ between insurers. The policy schedule and Key Facts documents are the best source for specifics.</p>

    <h3>How Insurers Assess an Application (Underwriting)</h3>
    <p>When someone applies, the insurer typically asks questions about age, lifestyle (e.g., smoking), medical history, occupation and sometimes pastimes. Based on this information, they decide whether to offer cover and at what premium. In some cases they may request further information from a GP or ask for a short medical.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What Happens When a Claim Is Made</h3>
    <p>If the person insured dies during the policy term, the policy owner (or a representative) notifies the insurer. The insurer then checks the claim against the policy terms and any underwriting information given at the start. If the claim is accepted, the benefit is paid as set out in the policy.</p>
    <p>Some people arrange for a policy to be held under a <strong>trust</strong> so proceeds are paid to trustees for beneficiaries and may bypass probate. Whether any payout forms part of an estate for tax purposes can depend on how the policy and trust are arranged. If unsure, check the documents and consider speaking to a regulated professional.</p>

    <h3>Myth vs Reality</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “Life insurance is only for older people.” <br><strong>Reality:</strong> Many people consider cover earlier in life; younger applicants often see lower premiums.</li>
      <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “All policies pay out the same way.” <br><strong>Reality:</strong> Some pay lump sums; others (like FIB) pay a regular income for the remaining term.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Key Questions to Ask Yourself</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Would your family have ongoing expenses or debts to cover without your income?</li>
      <li>Do you prefer a lump sum or a regular income for your household?</li>
      <li>How long might you want cover to last (e.g., to match a mortgage term)?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP)</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    A Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) is a type of personal pension that gives you more control and choice over how your retirement savings are invested.

    <h3>What Is a SIPP?</h3>
    <p>
      A SIPP is a flexible pension wrapper that allows you to choose from a wide range of investments — such as funds, shares, investment trusts, ETFs, and bonds — all within a tax-efficient pension environment.  
      You still receive the same tax relief on contributions as with other personal pensions, but you’re responsible for managing the investments (or appointing someone to do it on your behalf).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>📈 <strong>More control:</strong> Choose and manage your own investments or appoint a professional.</li>
      <li>💼 <strong>Tax relief:</strong> Contributions usually receive tax relief at your marginal income tax rate.</li>
      <li>🔁 <strong>Flexible access:</strong> Typically accessible from age 55 (rising to 57 in 2028) for lump sums, drawdown, or annuity.</li>
      <li>📊 <strong>Wide choice:</strong> Invest in shares, funds, bonds, commercial property, and more.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Contribution Limits (Information Only)</h3>
    <p>
      SIPP contributions are subject to the annual allowance and lifetime allowance (which was abolished but can still affect some protections). Key points:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>📅 <strong>Annual allowance:</strong> £60,000 (2025/26) or 100% of earnings, whichever is lower.</li>
      <li>💡 <strong>Carry forward:</strong> You may use unused allowance from the previous 3 tax years if eligible.</li>
      <li>💷 <strong>Tax relief:</strong> Basic-rate tax relief is added automatically; higher-rate relief may need to be claimed via self-assessment.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Things to Consider</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>✔️ Investments can fall as well as rise — your pension value is not guaranteed.</li>
      <li>✔️ You’re responsible for ongoing management and decisions unless you appoint an adviser.</li>
      <li>✔️ Accessing funds before retirement age is usually not possible without significant tax penalties.</li>
      <li>✔️ SIPPs are often more suitable for experienced investors or those seeking more control.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help">Always seek regulated advice before making pension decisions.</p>

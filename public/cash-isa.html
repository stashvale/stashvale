  <h2>Cash ISA</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    A Cash ISA is a tax-free savings account available to UK residents aged 16 or over. 
    It allows you to earn interest without paying tax on it, making it a simple, low-risk way to grow your savings.

    <h3>How a Cash ISA Works</h3>
    <p>
      A Cash ISA works much like a regular savings account, but with one key difference: any interest you earn is 
      completely free from UK income tax. Each tax year, you get an ISA allowance — £20,000 for the 2025/26 tax year — 
      which you can split between different ISA types (cash, stocks & shares, Lifetime ISA, etc.).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>💷 <strong>Tax-free interest:</strong> All interest earned within a Cash ISA is free from income tax.</li>
      <li>📅 <strong>Annual allowance:</strong> Up to £20,000 total ISA contributions across all ISA types.</li>
      <li>🔄 <strong>Flexible or fixed:</strong> Choose between easy-access accounts or fixed-rate deals for higher interest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Cash ISAs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Easy-access Cash ISA:</strong> Withdraw money anytime, but usually with lower interest rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Fixed-rate Cash ISA:</strong> Lock your money away for a set term (e.g. 1–5 years) in exchange for higher interest.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexible Cash ISA:</strong> Withdraw and replace money within the same tax year without losing your allowance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Things to Consider</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>⚠️ Interest rates on Cash ISAs are often lower than inflation, so your money may lose value in real terms.</li>
      <li>💡 If you’re unlikely to use your full Personal Savings Allowance, a Cash ISA may not offer a big advantage.</li>
      <li>🔁 You can transfer your ISA to another provider to chase better rates — but always check for penalties.</li>
    </ul>

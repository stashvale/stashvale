    <h1 id="title">Junior ISA Basics Explained</h1>
    <p class="lead">Information only. This guide explains the general features of Junior ISAs (JISAs). It is not financial advice or a personal recommendation.</p>

    <h2>What is a Junior ISA?</h2>
    <p>A Junior ISA is a long-term, tax-efficient account for children under 18. It is designed to help families save or invest for a child’s future. Money held in a JISA belongs to the child. Under current rules, the money is generally locked away until age 18. At 18, the account typically becomes an adult ISA and the young person gains full control.</p>

    <h2>Who can open and who can pay in?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A parent or legal guardian usually opens the account for an eligible child.</li>
      <li>Once open, contributions can usually be made by parents, guardians, relatives or friends.</li>
      <li>There is an annual allowance set by current rules. Providers publish how they apply it and what happens if payments exceed it.</li>
      <li>Payments are intended for the long term. Early withdrawals are not generally available.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Junior ISA</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cash JISA:</strong> Works like a savings account inside the JISA wrapper. Interest rates are set by the provider and can change. Capital is not invested in the stock market.</li>
      <li><strong>Stocks &amp; Shares JISA:</strong> Money is invested in funds or shares. Values can fall as well as rise, so the child could get back less than has been paid in. Charges may apply for the platform and underlying funds.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip" role="note">
      <strong>Neutral reminder:</strong> The JISA is the tax wrapper. With a Stocks &amp; Shares JISA, risk comes from the underlying investments, not the wrapper itself.
    </div>

    <h2>Ownership, control and access</h2>
    <p>The funds belong to the child. The adult who opened the account manages it until age 16–18 (providers set processes). At 18, control passes to the young person. They may keep the money invested, switch provider, or withdraw cash, following the applicable rules and provider terms.</p>

    <h2>Contributions and gifts</h2>
    <p>Anyone can contribute, subject to the annual allowance and the provider’s processes. Some families set up regular monthly payments; others make occasional gifts. Providers explain how to pay in, how to set up standing orders and how to stop or change payments.</p>

    <h2>Charges, interest and returns</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cash JISA:</strong> The provider sets interest rates and account terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Stocks &amp; Shares JISA:</strong> Typical costs may include platform fees and fund ongoing charges (and, in some cases, transaction costs). Providers publish details and examples.</li>
      <li>Returns are not guaranteed. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Transfers and switching</h2>
    <p>Under current rules, it is generally possible to transfer between JISA providers and between Cash and Stocks &amp; Shares JISAs. Transfers should be completed via providers to keep the tax-advantaged status; withdrawing money and repaying it later may not preserve the wrapper. Timescales and processes vary.</p>

    <h2>Moving from a Child Trust Fund (CTF)</h2>
    <p>Many children have a CTF. It is usually possible to transfer a CTF into a JISA. Providers can explain the steps, likely timescales and any restrictions. After a transfer, the JISA continues until age 18.</p>

    <h2>Example scenarios (illustrative only)</h2>
    <div class="note">
      <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A parent opens a Cash JISA for a 4-year-old and makes ad-hoc gifts from grandparents during birthdays. The aim is to build a simple pot for the child’s future. Interest rates may change over time.</p>
      <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A guardian opens a Stocks &amp; Shares JISA for a 10-year-old and contributes monthly. The money is invested in a diversified fund. The value can fall as well as rise, particularly in the short term.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Key points to consider</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>JISAs are designed for long-term saving; money is usually locked until age 18.</li>
      <li>Tax rules and allowances can change; effects depend on individual circumstances.</li>
      <li>Investment values can go down as well as up; a child could get back less than has been paid in.</li>
      <li>Provider processes (fees, forms, transfer timescales) vary. Check specific terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>Can a child hold more than one JISA?</h3>
    <p>Under current rules, a child can hold one Cash JISA and one Stocks &amp; Shares JISA at the same time. Transfers allow you to move between providers.</p>

    <h3>What happens at 18?</h3>
    <p>The account typically becomes an adult ISA and the young person gains full control. They can keep investing, switch, or withdraw according to the rules and terms in place at that time.</p>

    <h3>Can anyone contribute?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Once open, contributions from family and friends are usually allowed, subject to the annual allowance and provider processes.</p>

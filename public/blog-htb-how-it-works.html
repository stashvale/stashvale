    <h1 id="title">Help to Buy ISA: How It Worked</h1>
    <p class="lead">The Help to Buy ISA (HTB ISA) is closed to new applicants. Existing account holders may continue under scheme rules. This guide explains the core ideas in plain English.</p>

    <h2>What the scheme aimed to do</h2>
    <p>HTB ISAs were designed to support first-time buyers by adding a government bonus to eligible savings used for an eligible residential property purchase, where the scheme’s conditions were met.</p>

    <h2>Saving and managing the account</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Existing holders typically continued to save with their provider, subject to the scheme’s contribution limits and provider terms.</li>
      <li>Interest on cash held in the HTB ISA was paid by the provider according to the account rate.</li>
      <li>Transfers between providers were usually possible, following both provider processes and the scheme’s transfer rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>High-level eligibility concepts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>First-time buyer status</em> was required under the scheme’s definition.</li>
      <li>Property price caps and UK residential use conditions applied.</li>
      <li>Generally, a single HTB ISA bonus could be claimed per eligible purchase.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How the bonus was claimed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The provider did not automatically add the bonus. A conveyancer/solicitor usually claimed it during completion, following the scheme’s process.</li>
      <li>When you closed your HTB ISA to use funds for a purchase, the provider typically issued a closing statement. The conveyancer used this as evidence for the bonus claim.</li>
      <li>Forms, timeframes and evidence requirements were set by the scheme administrator and could be updated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key timing points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Deadlines applied to paying in, closing the account for a purchase, and the conveyancer’s claim submission.</li>
      <li>If you were not buying immediately, you could usually continue saving within the scheme until you decided to purchase or close the account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If plans changed</h2>
    <p>You could generally keep the account open (subject to provider terms) or close it and retain your savings without a bonus. Because the scheme is closed to new applicants, re-opening later may not have been possible.</p>

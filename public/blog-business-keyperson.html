  <h1>What Is Key Person Insurance?</h1>
  <p class="lead">A plain-English overview of how key person (key man / key woman) insurance works, why some companies consider it, and common points to check. <strong>This article is for information only — it is not financial, legal, accounting, or tax advice.</strong></p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>The Basic Idea</h3>
    <p>Key person insurance is a life (and sometimes critical illness) policy taken out by a business on an individual whose skills, knowledge, relationships, or revenue-generation are considered critical to the company. The <em>business</em> is usually the policy owner, pays the premiums, and is the beneficiary of any payout.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Who Might Be a “Key Person”?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Founders and senior executives who drive strategy or hold specialist know-how.</li>
      <li>Highly technical staff whose expertise is hard to replace quickly.</li>
      <li>Top salespeople or rainmakers linked to major accounts.</li>
      <li>Individuals essential to product development, compliance, or operations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">Each business defines “key” differently. Identification usually comes from impact on revenue, profitability, continuity, or financing obligations.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What Cover Can Do (Typical Uses of a Payout)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide working capital while recruiting and onboarding a replacement.</li>
      <li>Offset lost revenue or increased operating costs during disruption.</li>
      <li>Support loan repayments or meet covenants if lenders require continuity plans.</li>
      <li>Stabilise cash flow for suppliers and payroll during a transition period.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help">Actual use of proceeds is a commercial decision for the company and may be influenced by loan agreements or shareholder expectations.</p>

    <h3>Common Policy Structures &amp; Options (Information Only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Life only vs life with critical illness:</strong> Some companies include critical illness; others keep it to life cover only.</li>
      <li><strong>Term length:</strong> Often aligned with forecast replacement timeframes, project cycles, debt terms, or investor requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>Sum assured:</strong> Sometimes estimated from multiples of profit contribution, gross profit, or replacement costs. Methods vary.</li>
      <li><strong>Premium basis:</strong> Level or reviewable, depending on the product.</li>
      <li><strong>Ownership &amp; beneficiary:</strong> Typically the company; wording should reflect commercial intent.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Tax, Accounting &amp; Legal Notes (High Level Only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tax:</strong> Treatment of premiums and proceeds can depend on purpose, policy terms and local rules. Tax rules can change.</li>
      <li><strong>Accounting:</strong> Presentation may differ by jurisdiction and standards. Professional accounting advice is recommended.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal:</strong> Board approvals, employment status, and insurable interest considerations can apply.</li>
      <li><strong>Underwriting:</strong> Medical and financial underwriting normally applies. Non-disclosure can affect claims.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help">Businesses commonly obtain professional advice (tax, legal, accounting and regulated insurance advice) before proceeding.</p>

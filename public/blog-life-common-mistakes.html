  <h2>Common Life Insurance Mistakes to Be Aware Of</h2>
  <p class="lead"><strong>Information only — not financial advice.</strong> This guide highlights typical areas where people sometimes find their cover doesn’t work as expected. It’s designed to help you ask the right questions when reading policy documents.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>1) Cover Amount That No Longer Matches the Need</h3>
    <p>Life changes can mean the original amount of cover feels high or low for current circumstances. Some people look at big outgoings (like a mortgage or childcare) and consider whether their existing payout would still provide the support they want for loved ones.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>2) Term Length That Doesn’t Line Up</h3>
    <p>Policies run for a set period. If the term ends earlier than key commitments (e.g., years left on a mortgage), the timing may not align with expectations. Conversely, some find they continue paying for longer than needed if debts or obligations reduce faster than expected.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>3) Not Understanding the Policy Type</h3>
    <p>Level, decreasing and family income benefit have different purposes. For example, decreasing cover usually reduces in line with a repayment mortgage, while FIB pays a regular income rather than a lump sum. Checking the policy summary helps clarify how payments would be made.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>4) Paperwork and Beneficiaries Not Up to Date</h3>
    <p>Some people periodically check that beneficiaries and any trust paperwork still reflect current wishes. Where a trust is used, it may help benefits reach intended recipients more smoothly. Tax and estate outcomes depend on how the policy and any trust are arranged, so documents are key.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Myth vs Reality</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “All claims are handled the same way.” <br><strong>Reality:</strong> Processes and definitions differ by insurer, so the policy wording matters.</li>
      <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “Putting a policy in trust is always the right answer.” <br><strong>Reality:</strong> Trusts are a common arrangement, but suitability depends on individual circumstances and how documents are set up.</li>
    </ul>

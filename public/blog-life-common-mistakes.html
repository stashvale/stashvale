  <h2>Common Life Insurance Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
  <p class="lead">Life insurance can be straightforward, but small oversights can make a big difference. Here are some of the most frequent mistakes — and how to avoid them. <strong>Information only – not advice.</strong></p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>1. Underestimating How Much Cover You Need</h3>
    <p>One of the biggest mistakes is choosing a payout that doesn’t fully meet your family’s needs. Think beyond the mortgage — factor in childcare, education, ongoing living costs, and inflation.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>2. Choosing the Wrong Policy Type</h3>
    <p>Level term, decreasing term, and family income benefit all serve different purposes. Choosing the wrong one could mean you’re either overpaying or not properly protected.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>3. Forgetting to Review Regularly</h3>
    <p>Life circumstances change. A policy you took out 10 years ago might not reflect your current financial situation. Regular reviews ensure your cover remains suitable.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>4. Not Writing Your Policy Into Trust</h3>
    <p>If your policy isn’t written into trust, the payout may be delayed by probate or counted as part of your estate, potentially increasing inheritance tax liability.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>5. Cancelling Without a Replacement</h3>
    <p>If you cancel a policy before setting up a new one, you could be left without cover — and premiums may be higher if you reapply later due to age or health changes.</p>

    <h1 id="title">How to Transfer a Junior ISA</h1>
    <p class="lead">Information only. This guide outlines how Junior ISA transfers typically work, including moving from a Child Trust Fund (CTF) to a Junior ISA. Processes vary by provider.</p>

    <h2>Before you start</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Check the child’s eligibility and confirm the existing account type (Cash JISA, Stocks &amp; Shares JISA, or CTF).</li>
      <li>Ask the new provider about their transfer pack, ID requirements and typical timescales.</li>
      <li>To retain the tax-advantaged status, transfers are usually completed by providers. Withdrawing money and paying it back in later may not preserve the wrapper.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Typical transfer steps</h2>
    <div class="step"><strong>1) Choose the receiving provider.</strong> Review their charges, available investments (if applicable) and online access features.</div>
    <div class="step"><strong>2) Request a transfer form.</strong> Provide details of the existing account and whether you want to transfer all or (if permitted) part of the balance.</div>
    <div class="step"><strong>3) Provider-to-provider transfer.</strong> The receiving provider coordinates with the existing provider. Cash JISAs usually move as cash. Stocks &amp; Shares JISAs may be sold and repurchased (exact process varies).</div>
    <div class="step"><strong>4) Confirmation.</strong> When complete, the receiving provider confirms the new account is active and the transfer has finished.</div>

    <h2>Transferring from a Child Trust Fund (CTF)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Under current rules, it is generally possible to move a CTF into a JISA. After the transfer, the JISA continues for the child until age 18.</li>
      <li>Ask providers about any differences in timings or forms compared with a JISA-to-JISA transfer.</li>
      <li>While the transfer is in progress, contributions may be paused until the new account is active (provider processes vary).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Timing, charges and what can vary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Timescales:</strong> These depend on both providers and the type of assets involved.</li>
      <li><strong>Charges:</strong> Platform charges, fund charges and any exit or transfer-out fees depend on providers and products.</li>
      <li><strong>Market movement:</strong> For Stocks &amp; Shares JISAs, values can move during the transfer process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical tips (neutral)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep copies of forms and confirmations.</li>
      <li>Ask how you will be notified when regular payments should resume.</li>
      <li>If moving investments, ask whether assets are transferred “in specie” (where available) or by selling and repurchasing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>Can you transfer part of a JISA?</h3>
    <p>Some providers allow partial transfers; others require full transfers. Check the receiving provider’s rules and the current regulations.</p>

    <h3>Will the child’s allowance be affected?</h3>
    <p>The annual allowance is separate from transfers. Providers explain how they track payments in the tax year.</p>

    <h3>Can a CTF be kept instead?</h3>
    <p>Some families keep a CTF until maturity; others transfer to a JISA. Providers can explain differences in features and processes.</p>

    <h2>Balanced points to consider</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provider processes vary. Ask about forms, identification, transfer timescales and whether payments should pause.</li>
      <li>For Stocks &amp; Shares JISAs, investment values can fall as well as rise; you may receive back less than has been paid in.</li>
      <li>Tax rules and allowances can change; effects depend on individual circumstances.</li>
    </ul>

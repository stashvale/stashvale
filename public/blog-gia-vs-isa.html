    <h1 id="title">GIA vs ISA – Which Might Suit You?</h1>
    <p class="lead">Information only. This guide explains general differences between a General Investment Account (GIA) and an Individual Savings Account (ISA). It does not recommend any product or approach.</p>

    <h2>What is a GIA?</h2>
    <p>A General Investment Account is a flexible account for holding investments such as funds or shares outside a tax wrapper. There is normally no wrapper-based annual contribution limit. Returns may be taxable under current rules (for example, capital gains above available allowances, or dividend/interest income within personal tax rules).</p>

    <h2>What is an ISA?</h2>
    <p>An ISA is a tax-advantaged wrapper. Qualifying investments held inside an ISA are generally sheltered from UK income tax and capital gains tax under current rules. There is an overall annual ISA subscription limit and product-specific rules (e.g., Cash ISA vs Stocks &amp; Shares ISA).</p>

    <h2>Key differences at a glance</h2>

    <h2>How they can work together</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Some investors use an ISA up to the annual allowance and hold additional investments in a GIA.</li>
      <li>Transfers between providers are possible under each product’s rules and processes.</li>
      <li>Dividends, interest and gains in a GIA may create a personal tax position. Providers and HMRC guidance explain reporting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Points to check with a provider</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Charges (platform, fund and transaction) and how they are taken.</li>
      <li>Eligible investments and any minimum/maximum payments.</li>
      <li>Withdrawal and transfer processes, timescales and restrictions.</li>
      <li>Statements, tax certificates and annual summaries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common questions</h2>
    <h3>Is a GIA “worse” than an ISA?</h3>
    <p>They are different tools. An ISA uses a tax wrapper with an annual allowance. A GIA has no wrapper allowance but may create a personal tax position. Neither is inherently better; it depends on personal circumstances and goals.</p>

    <h3>Can you move assets from a GIA into an ISA?</h3>
    <p>Subscriptions to an ISA are limited by the ISA allowance and provider processes. Some providers support “bed &amp; ISA” transactions (sell in GIA, repurchase in ISA); charges and tax considerations may apply. Providers explain details.</p>

    <h3>Do you pay tax inside an ISA?</h3>
    <p>Under current UK rules, returns within an ISA are generally exempt from UK income and capital gains tax. Rules can change and may depend on personal circumstances.</p>

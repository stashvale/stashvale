  <h2>How Critical Illness Cover Works</h2>
  <p class="lead"><strong>Information only — not financial advice.</strong> This guide explains, in plain English, how critical illness cover (CIC) generally operates, what “defined conditions” means, and why policy wording matters.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What a CIC Policy Is Designed to Do</h3>
    <p>CIC is intended to pay a benefit if the person insured is diagnosed with a condition that meets the policy’s definition during the term. The payout is usually a lump sum, though some policies have partial payments for less severe diagnoses of specific conditions.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Defined Conditions & Why Wording Matters</h3>
    <p>Policies list covered conditions (for example, certain cancers, heart attack, stroke, MS) and the precise definitions used for a valid claim. These definitions vary by insurer and may be updated for new products over time. The Key Facts and policy wording set out exactly what qualifies.</p>
    <p class="help">Two policies can both say “cancer” but use different staging or severity criteria. Always check the wording for the product in question.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Underwriting & Disclosures</h3>
    <p>Applications typically ask about age, medical history, family history, smoking status and lifestyle. Insurers use this information to assess risk and set premiums or apply exclusions. Honest, complete answers are essential; non-disclosure can affect future claims.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Partial Payments & Additional Features</h3>
    <p>Some modern products include partial payouts for specified lower-severity conditions, children’s cover, or additional support services. Availability and amounts vary significantly by insurer and product version.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Myth vs Reality</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “If an illness is listed, it always pays.”<br><strong>Reality:</strong> The diagnosis must meet the policy’s exact definition and criteria.</li>
      <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “All CIC policies are broadly the same.”<br><strong>Reality:</strong> Definitions, partial payments and extras differ widely between insurers.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Key Questions to Ask Yourself</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Would a lump sum help with treatment, adapting your home or reducing financial pressure?</li>
      <li>Do you understand which conditions are covered and how they’re defined?</li>
      <li>Are there exclusions or special terms on your policy (if you have one)?</li>
    </ul>

  <h1>Whole of Life vs Term — What’s the Difference?</h1>
  <p class="lead">This guide explains, in plain English, how whole of life and term life insurance differ. It is general information only — <strong>not</strong> advice and <strong>not</strong> a recommendation.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>At a Glance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Whole of Life (WOL):</strong> Aims to cover your <em>entire lifetime</em>. A payout is guaranteed on death (if premiums are maintained and terms are met).</li>
      <li><strong>Term Life:</strong> Covers a <em>fixed period</em> (e.g., 10–30 years). It pays out only if death occurs during the policy term.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost:</strong> WOL typically has higher overall cost than like-for-like term because cover lasts for life.</li>
      <li><strong>Common uses:</strong> WOL is often linked to estate planning or funeral planning; term is often linked to income/loan/mortgage needs within a time frame.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>How Payouts Work</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Whole of Life:</strong> Pays a lump sum when the insured person dies, whenever that occurs, provided the policy is in force.</li>
      <li><strong>Term Life:</strong> Pays a lump sum if death happens within the selected term. No payout if the term ends without a claim.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">Policy definitions, exclusions and underwriting can affect claims. Always read the policy documents.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Premium Patterns (High Level)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Whole of Life:</strong> Premiums may be guaranteed (fixed) or reviewable (periodically reassessed under the policy terms). See our premiums guide for more detail.</li>
      <li><strong>Term Life:</strong> Premiums are commonly guaranteed for the term. Some policies allow limited reviewability under set conditions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Common Use Cases (Information Only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Whole of Life:</strong> Some people use it within wider estate planning, or for funeral-cost planning. Ownership/trust structure can matter for timing and who receives the payout.</li>
      <li><strong>Term Life:</strong> Often aligned to time-bound needs (e.g., supporting children to independence or covering a mortgage term).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">Tax treatment and suitability depend on individual circumstances and may change. Professional advice can help with tax/estate planning.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Key Things to Remember</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>WOL aims to last for life; term aims to last for a set period.</li>
      <li>Payouts depend on the policy being in force and meeting definitions and conditions.</li>
      <li>Premium type (guaranteed vs reviewable) affects price certainty over time.</li>
      <li>Trusts and ownership can influence how quickly and to whom proceeds are paid.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Illustrative Examples (Not Advice)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example A:</strong> Someone planning for potential funeral costs in later life might look at WOL to provide a lifelong lump sum on death.</li>
      <li><strong>Example B:</strong> Someone wanting cover until their children are financially independent might look at a 20–25-year term policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">These are generic examples to explain concepts. Individual needs vary.</p>

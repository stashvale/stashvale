  <h2>Help to Buy ISA <span class="badge">Closed to new accounts</span></h2>
  <p class="lead">
    The Help to Buy ISA scheme <strong>closed to new applicants</strong> on 30 November 2019. If you already have one,
    you can typically continue paying in until <strong>30 November 2029</strong> and use the government bonus when buying your first home
    (bonus claim deadlines apply). <strong>Information only — not financial advice.</strong>

    <h3>How a Help to Buy ISA Works (for existing holders)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You save cash and earn interest tax-free within the ISA wrapper.</li>
      <li>When you buy your first qualifying home with a mortgage, a <strong>25% government bonus</strong> can be added to your savings (up to scheme limits).</li>
      <li>There are monthly subscription limits and rules on how/when the bonus is claimed via your conveyancer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help">Exact limits, deadlines and provider rules apply. If unsure, check your provider’s documentation and official guidance.</p>

    <h3>Key Considerations (Information Only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Help to Buy ISA accounts can’t be newly opened, but existing holders may continue under scheme rules and timelines.</li>
      <li>Lifetime ISAs carry a withdrawal charge if used for reasons other than a first home (after 12 months) or from age 60.</li>
      <li>Cash ISAs don’t offer a bonus but keep interest free from UK income tax.</li>
    </ul>

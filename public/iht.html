  <h2>IHT (Inheritance Tax)</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    IHT is a tax that may be charged on an estate when someone dies. This page explains key ideas in plain English —
    <strong>information only</strong> and <strong>not regulated financial or tax advice</strong>.
  </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nil-rate bands:</strong> Estates can benefit from tax-free allowances (including a main band and, in some cases, a residence-related band). Unused allowances may be transferable between spouses/civil partners.</li>
      <li><strong>What’s in the estate:</strong> Usually the value of property, savings, investments and certain lifetime gifts. Liabilities can reduce the estate value.</li>
      <li><strong>When IHT is due:</strong> Typically on death, sometimes on certain trust events. Executors/administrators handle reporting and any tax payable from the estate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Thresholds, reliefs and rules can change. Always check current official guidance if you need specifics.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Gifts & Exemptions (Overview)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Exempt gifts:</strong> Certain gifts are immediately outside of IHT (e.g., some gifts to spouses/civil partners or charities, and specific small/annual gifts within limits).</li>
      <li><strong>Potentially exempt transfers:</strong> Larger gifts to individuals may become outside of IHT if the donor survives for a period after making the gift.</li>
      <li><strong>Regular gifts from surplus income:</strong> Some regular gifts may be exempt if they meet strict criteria and don’t reduce the giver’s standard of living.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Records are important: dates, amounts, recipients and the nature of gifts.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Trusts (High-Level Only)</h3>
    <p>
      Trusts are legal arrangements that can control how assets are held and passed on. Different trust types have different tax treatments and reporting duties. This is a complex area and usually requires professional advice.

    <h3>Using Life Insurance with IHT (Information Only)</h3>
    <p>
      Some people consider life insurance (often written in an appropriate trust) with the aim of helping beneficiaries meet any IHT bill.
      This can affect who receives the proceeds and how quickly, but it does not reduce the estate’s value by itself. Suitability depends on personal circumstances.

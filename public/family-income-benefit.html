  <h2>Family Income Benefit (FIB)</h2>
  <p class="lead">Family Income Benefit (FIB) is a type of life insurance that pays a **regular monthly income** to your loved ones if you pass away during the policy term. It’s designed to provide ongoing financial support rather than a single lump sum. <strong>Information only — not advice.</strong></p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>How Family Income Benefit Works</h3>
    <p>Unlike a standard life insurance policy that pays out a one-off lump sum, Family Income Benefit pays a **tax-free monthly income** for the remainder of the policy term. This means your family can plan their finances more easily and receive steady support instead of needing to manage a single large payment.</p>
    <p>For example, if you took out a 25-year policy and passed away in year 15, the policy would pay a monthly income for the remaining 10 years.</p>

    <h3>FIB vs. Lump-Sum Life Insurance</h3>
    <p>Both options aim to protect your family financially — but they do it differently:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>FIB:</strong> Regular monthly payments until the end of the policy term. Great for replacing income or covering everyday costs.</li>
      <li><strong>Lump-sum cover:</strong> A single payment. Useful for clearing a mortgage, paying off debts, or leaving an inheritance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many people combine the two — for example, a lump sum to repay the mortgage and FIB to replace lost income.</p>

    <h3>Things to Consider (Information Only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How long you’ll need income support (e.g. until children reach adulthood).</li>
      <li>Whether the amount of monthly income will keep pace with inflation.</li>
      <li>Placing the policy in trust can help speed up payment and avoid inheritance tax issues.</li>
      <li>Premiums vary based on age, health, smoking status, and the level of income chosen.</li>
    </ul>

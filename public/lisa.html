  <h2>Lifetime ISA (LISA)</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    A Lifetime ISA (LISA) is a government-backed savings account designed to help you save for your first home or for retirement, with a valuable annual bonus.

  <section class="card">
    <h3>How a LISA Works</h3>
    <p>
      A Lifetime ISA is available to individuals aged 18–39 and allows you to save up to £4,000 each tax year. The government adds a 25% bonus on top of what you save — up to £1,000 per year.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>🏠 <strong>First home:</strong> Use your LISA savings and bonus to buy your first property (up to £450,000) after 12 months.</li>
      <li>👵 <strong>Retirement:</strong> Withdraw from age 60 to boost your retirement savings tax-free.</li>
      <li>💸 <strong>Penalty if used otherwise:</strong> 25% withdrawal charge if funds are taken out for other purposes (you lose the bonus and more).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Eligibility & Key Rules</h3>
    <p>To open and contribute to a LISA, you must meet certain conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✔️ Aged 18–39 to open. You can contribute until age 50.</li>
      <li>✔️ Save up to £4,000 per tax year — part of your £20,000 total ISA allowance.</li>
      <li>✔️ Bonus is paid monthly on contributions and compounds over time.</li>
      <li>✔️ Property purchase must be via a mortgage and the property value under £450,000.</li>
      <li>✔️ Account must be open for at least 12 months before you can use it for a property purchase.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Things to Consider</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>⚠️ Withdrawing early (for reasons other than home purchase or retirement) incurs a 25% charge.</li>
      <li>⚠️ A LISA should be part of a broader savings or retirement plan — not your only retirement solution.</li>
      <li>⚠️ Stocks & Shares LISAs offer higher growth potential but come with investment risk. Cash LISAs are lower risk but offer less potential growth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help">Always seek regulated financial advice before making significant savings or investment decisions.</p>

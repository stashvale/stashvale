  <h1>Should Whole of Life Be in Trust? (Information Only)</h1>
  <p class="lead">This guide explains common reasons people consider using a trust with a whole of life policy. It is general information only — <strong>not</strong> legal, tax or financial advice.</p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>What Is a Trust in This Context?</h3>
    <p>A trust is a legal arrangement that can allow policy proceeds to be paid to chosen beneficiaries, usually without forming part of the estate for probate. Different trust types exist and have different rules.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Why Some People Consider a Trust</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Beneficiary certainty:</strong> Indicates who should receive the proceeds.</li>
      <li><strong>Potentially faster access:</strong> Proceeds held under a valid trust may be paid without waiting for probate, depending on the trust and circumstances.</li>
      <li><strong>Estate planning:</strong> Trusts can support wider planning aims. Tax treatment depends on the trust type and personal circumstances.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Common Trust Approaches (High Level)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fixed/expression trusts:</strong> Beneficiaries are specified.</li>
      <li><strong>Discretionary trusts:</strong> Trustees have discretion over who benefits within a defined class, following the settlor’s wishes letter.</li>
      <li><strong>Survivorship/second-death contexts:</strong> Where policies are used alongside wills and estate planning, specialist advice is commonly sought.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">The appropriate trust (if any) depends on individual goals, family situation and legal/tax considerations.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Ownership, Trustees &amp; Control</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Policy owner/settlor:</strong> The person(s) setting up the trust.</li>
      <li><strong>Trustees:</strong> Individuals who administer the trust according to its terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Beneficiaries:</strong> The people intended to benefit from proceeds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Trust documentation sets out who can do what. It’s important to keep trustee and beneficiary details up to date.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Potential Drawbacks to Be Aware Of</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Once a trust is set up, changes may be limited by the trust terms and the law.</li>
      <li>Certain trust types can have tax reporting/periodic charges depending on value and jurisdiction.</li>
      <li>Incorrect setup could lead to delays or outcomes different from what was intended.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">Because trusts are legal arrangements with tax implications, professional advice is commonly sought.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Illustrative Examples (Not Advice)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example A:</strong> A person wants policy proceeds to be available quickly to help with funeral costs. They consider using a trust so trustees can receive funds directly from the insurer.</li>
      <li><strong>Example B:</strong> A couple using WOL for estate planning consider a discretionary trust so trustees can distribute funds in line with their letter of wishes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">These are generic illustrations only. Individual goals and legal/tax positions differ.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Key Points to Remember</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Trusts can help with payment speed and beneficiary direction, but they are legal documents with responsibilities.</li>
      <li>Tax rules and product terms can change. Treatment depends on individual circumstances.</li>
      <li>Specialist legal/tax advice is usually appropriate before setting up a trust.</li>
    </ul>

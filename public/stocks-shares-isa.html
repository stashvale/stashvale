  <h2>Stocks & Shares ISA</h2>
  <p class="lead">A tax-efficient investment account allowing you to invest in funds, shares, bonds, and more. Potential for growth is higher than cash savings — but so is the risk. <strong>This page is for information only and not financial advice.</strong></p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You can invest up to £20,000 each tax year (combined across all ISAs).</li>
      <li>Any growth, dividends, or interest earned inside the ISA is free from UK income and capital gains tax.</li>
      <li>Investments can go up or down in value — you might get back less than you put in.</li>
      <li>You can withdraw money at any time (though this may reduce long-term growth potential).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help">ISAs must be held in your own name and are available to UK residents aged 18 or over.</p>

    <h3>Why People Use Stocks & Shares ISAs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To invest tax-efficiently for long-term goals (5+ years).</li>
      <li>To build wealth without paying capital gains or dividend tax.</li>
      <li>As part of a retirement strategy (often alongside pensions).</li>
      <li>For future goals such as children’s education or home deposits.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Considerations (Information Only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Investing is best for long-term horizons — markets fluctuate in the short term.</li>
      <li>Diversification (spreading investments) can help reduce risk.</li>
      <li>Charges vary between providers and funds — these can affect returns.</li>
      <li>Past performance isn’t a guide to future returns.</li>
    </ul>

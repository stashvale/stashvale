  <h2>Cash ISA: Basics Explained</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    A Cash ISA is a savings account where the interest is paid tax-free within annual ISA limits.
    This guide explains the essentials in plain English. It is <strong>information only</strong> and isn’t financial advice.

    <h3>What a Cash ISA is (in simple terms)</h3>
    <p>
      A Cash ISA is a UK savings product that lets individuals earn interest without paying income tax on that interest,
      up to the annual ISA allowance set by the government. Some people use Cash ISAs for short-term savings or to
      maintain an emergency buffer. Rates can be <em>easy access</em> (withdrawals allowed) or <em>fixed term</em> (committing
      money for a set period, often for a higher rate). Providers set their own terms, rates, and minimum balances.

    <h3>Key features at a glance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tax-free interest</strong> within the annual ISA allowance.</li>
      <li><strong>Easy access</strong> or <strong>fixed-term</strong> options, depending on provider.</li>
      <li><strong>Cash only</strong> (not invested in the stock market), so values don’t go up or down with markets.</li>
      <li><strong>UK regulation</strong>: ISAs are a UK framework; individual accounts are provided by authorised institutions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="help">Tax treatment depends on individual circumstances and may change in future.</p>

    <h3>How Cash ISAs differ from other ISAs</h3>
    <p>
      A Cash ISA holds cash deposits. By contrast, a Stocks & Shares ISA holds investments such as funds or shares,
      which can fall as well as rise in value. A Lifetime ISA (LISA) has age, usage, and withdrawal conditions and
      includes a government bonus for eligible uses. Individuals often compare rates, access, time horizons, and risk.

    <h3>FAQs (non-advisory)</h3>
    <p><strong>Allowances:</strong> There is an annual ISA allowance across ISA types. Rules can change, and some people check the latest official guidance each tax year.</p>
    <p><strong>One Cash ISA per year?</strong> People often check current rules — in some years you may be allowed to subscribe to more than one Cash ISA as long as you don’t exceed the overall allowance, but providers may have practical restrictions.</p>
    <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> UK residency, age and identity checks typically apply. Providers set their own terms.</p>

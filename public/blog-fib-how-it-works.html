  <h2>How Family Income Benefit Works</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Family Income Benefit (FIB) is an insurance policy that, if the insured person dies during the policy term,
    pays a regular, tax-free income to the chosen beneficiaries for the remainder of that term. This guide explains the
    main mechanics in plain English. <strong>This page is for information only — not financial advice.</strong>
  </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>The Basics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Provide ongoing income rather than a single lump sum.</li>
      <li><strong>Policy term:</strong> A fixed number of years (e.g., until children reach financial independence).</li>
      <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> A monthly (or yearly) payout that runs until the end of the term if a valid claim occurs.</li>
      <li><strong>Premiums:</strong> Paid monthly. Cost depends on age, health, smoker status, length of term, benefit level, and policy features.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>How the Payout Works</h3>
    <p>If a valid claim happens within the term, the policy pays the insured income for the rest of that term. For example, if a 20-year policy is set up for £1,800 per month and a valid claim occurs in year 7, the income is typically paid for the remaining 13 years.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Level vs. indexed income:</strong> Some policies allow the income to rise each year (e.g., in line with inflation caps). Indexation usually increases premiums over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Guaranteed vs. reviewable premiums:</strong> Guaranteed premiums remain fixed (apart from indexation). Reviewable premiums can change under the insurer’s rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Deferred periods:</strong> FIB usually doesn’t have a deferred period (unlike income protection); payments start after claim approval.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h3>Setting the Term &amp; Amount (Information Only)</h3>
    <p>People often align the term to key milestones — for example, the youngest child’s likely independence age. The monthly amount is typically chosen to help cover essential outgoings. This is general information only; individual circumstances vary widely.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Claims &amp; Trusts (General Information)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Making a claim:</strong> A representative/beneficiary submits a claim with required evidence (e.g., death certificate). Insurers assess claims against policy terms and definitions.</li>
      <li><strong>Using a trust:</strong> Many people place policies in trust so proceeds are paid to the intended beneficiaries efficiently. Trust options and effects can vary and may have legal/tax implications.</li>
      <li><strong>Tax:</strong> UK tax treatment can depend on personal circumstances and may change. Professional guidance may be appropriate for tax questions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Key Points to Remember</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Policy terms, exclusions, and definitions vary by insurer and product version.</li>
      <li>Missing premiums usually leads to the policy ending without value.</li>
      <li>Regular reviews can help keep cover aligned to life events (e.g., children growing up).</li>
    </ul>

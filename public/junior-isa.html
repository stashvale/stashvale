  <h2>Junior ISA (JISA)</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    A Junior ISA (JISA) is a long-term, tax-free savings or investment account for children under 18. 
    It’s designed to help parents and guardians build a financial head start for their child’s future.

    <h3>How a Junior ISA Works</h3>
    <p>
      Anyone with parental responsibility for a child can open a Junior ISA on their behalf. 
      Family and friends can contribute up to the annual limit (£9,000 for the 2025/26 tax year), 
      and all interest, dividends, or capital growth are free from UK tax. The money is locked away 
      until the child turns 18, at which point it becomes theirs automatically.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>👶 <strong>Eligibility:</strong> Available to UK residents under 18 who do not have a Child Trust Fund.</li>
      <li>💰 <strong>Tax-free growth:</strong> All interest, dividends and gains within a JISA are free from income and capital gains tax.</li>
      <li>🎁 <strong>Contributions:</strong> Anyone can contribute, but the total must not exceed £9,000 per tax year.</li>
      <li>🔐 <strong>Access:</strong> Funds can’t be withdrawn until age 18 (except in rare circumstances such as terminal illness).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Junior ISA</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Junior Cash ISA:</strong> Works like a regular savings account, with tax-free interest and no risk to capital.</li>
      <li><strong>Junior Stocks & Shares ISA:</strong> Invested in markets for the potential of higher returns over the long term, but with more risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Things to Consider</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>💡 The money becomes the child’s at 18 — they control how it’s used.</li>
      <li>📈 A Stocks & Shares JISA may offer higher growth potential, but the value can go down as well as up.</li>
      <li>🔁 You can transfer between JISA providers or switch between cash and stocks & shares at any time.</li>
    </ul>
